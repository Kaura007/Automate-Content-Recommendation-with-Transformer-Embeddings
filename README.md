# Automate Content Recommendation with Transformer Embeddings

This project explores leveraging transformer embeddings for text segmentation and content recommendation. By converting text data into numerical representations that capture semantic meaning, we can efficiently group similar content and build effective recommendation systems.

## Business Impact

In today's data-driven world, businesses are constantly looking for ways to personalize user experiences and improve content discoverability. This project demonstrates a powerful approach to achieve these goals:

* **Enhanced User Engagement:** By recommending relevant content based on user preferences and semantic similarity, businesses can keep users engaged and increase time spent on their platforms.
* **Improved Content Discoverability:** Text segmentation and clustering help organize large content libraries, making it easier for users to find what they are looking for and for businesses to understand their content landscape.
* **Targeted Marketing and Advertising:** Understanding content clusters allows for more targeted marketing campaigns and personalized advertising, leading to higher conversion rates.
* **Automated Content Curation:** The system can automate the process of grouping and categorizing content, saving time and resources for content managers.
* **Competitive Advantage:** Implementing advanced recommendation systems can provide a significant competitive edge in industries relying heavily on content, such as e-commerce, media, and education.

## Real-World Use Cases

The techniques explored in this project have numerous real-world applications across various domains:

* **E-commerce Product Recommendation:** Recommend products to customers based on their browsing history and the semantic similarity of product descriptions.
* **News Article Recommendation:** Personalize news feeds for readers by clustering articles based on topics and recommending articles similar to those they have read before.
* **Streaming Service Content Recommendation:** Suggest movies, TV shows, or music to users based on their viewing or listening history and the semantic content of the media.
* **Online Course Recommendation:** Recommend relevant courses to students based on their learning interests and the content of courses they have already taken.
* **Document Organization and Search:** Improve document management systems by clustering similar documents and enhancing search capabilities based on semantic understanding.
* **Customer Support Ticket Routing:** Automatically route customer support tickets to the appropriate teams based on the content and nature of the issue.

This project guides you through the following key stages:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration:** Loading and understanding the structure of the dataset.
2.  **Generate Text Embeddings:** Using pre-trained transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa, MiniLM) to convert text into numerical embeddings.
3.  **Dimensionality Reduction:** Applying techniques like PCA and UMAP to reduce the complexity of the embedding space while preserving important information.
4.  **Clustering:** Grouping similar content descriptions using algorithms such as K-Means, FAISS, and Agglomerative Clustering.
5.  **Finding the Best Performing Model:** Evaluating different combinations of embedding models, dimensionality reduction techniques, and clustering algorithms.
6.  **Inference:** Demonstrating how to use the trained model for content recommendation.
7.  **Streamlit User Interface:** Building a simple web application for interactive content recommendation.
